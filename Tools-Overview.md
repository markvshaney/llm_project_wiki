# Development Tools

## VS Code
VS Code is our primary IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that provides:
- Syntax highlighting and intelligent code completion
- Debugging tools
- Git integration
- Extensions for various programming languages
- Integrated terminal

> **Note:** VS Code integrates well with Conda - you can select your Conda environment directly within VS Code.

## Conda
Conda is our package and environment management system that:
- Manages Python packages and their dependencies
- Virtual environments: Creates isolated environments with specific Python versions and packages
- Cross-platform dependency management: Handles non-Python libraries and dependencies (especially useful for data science)
- Can install packages from different sources (conda-forge, pip, etc.)

## Docker
Docker is a platform that uses containers to make application deployment and development consistent across different environments. It solves the "it works on my machine" problem by packaging your application and all its dependencies together.
Benefits
* Consistent Environments: Applications run the same way everywhere
* Isolation: Each project/service runs in its own container
* Version Control: Easy management of different versions of dependencies
* Quick Deployment: Fast and consistent deployment process

## WSL
* The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows 11 offers many benefits, but there are some downsides to consider as well:
* Performance: WSL can be slower than running Linux natively or using a virtual machine. This is because it uses software emulation to run Linux programs2.
* Compatibility: Not all Linux programs work perfectly in WSL. Some applications may have issues or not work at all2.
* Filesystem Performance: WSL's filesystem performance can be slower, especially for large projects.
* Resource Usage: Running WSL can consume additional system resources, which might be a concern for less powerful machines.
* Privacy Concerns: Since WSL runs within Windows, there might be privacy concerns for some users.
* Despite these downsides, WSL is still a powerful tool for developers and those who need to run Linux tools on a Windows machine
