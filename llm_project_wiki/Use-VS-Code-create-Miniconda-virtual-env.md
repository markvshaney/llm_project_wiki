## Prerequisites
Before beginning, ensure you have:
- Administrative access to your machine

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Conda

First, install Conda by downloading either Anaconda or Miniconda:
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

### 2. Create a Conda Environment

Open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt) and create a new Conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.9
```

Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name and `3.9` with your preferred Python version.

### 3. Activate the Conda Environment

Activate your newly created environment:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

### 4. Install Required Packages

Install the necessary packages:

For Exmple:

```bash
#use Ollama to pull and run mistral
pip install ollama mistral
```

### 5. Configure VS Code

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Open the integrated terminal (Shortcut: `Ctrl+``)
3. Select the Conda Environment:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette
   - Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
   - Select your Conda environment (e.g., `myenv`)

### 6. Create Your Python Script

   For example:
      Create a new file named `run_mistral.py` with the following template:

      ```python
         import ollama
         import mistral

   # Initialize model
   model = ollama.load_model('mistral')

   # Example usage
   result = model.run(input_data)
   print(result)
   ```

### 7. Execute the Script

Run your script from the integrated terminal:

```bash
python run_mistral.py
```

## Additional Configuration

### VS Code Settings

Create a `.vscode/settings.json` file in your project directory:

```json
{
    "python.pythonPath": "/path/to/your/conda/env/bin/python",
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/path/to/your/conda/env/bin/python"
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/conda/env/bin/python` with the actual path to your Conda environment's Python executable.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. If Conda environment is not visible in VS Code:
   - Restart VS Code
   - Ensure Conda is properly installed and added to system PATH

2. If packages fail to install:
   - Verify your internet connection
   - Check that you're in the correct Conda environment
   - Try updating pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

## Next Steps

After completing the setup:
1. Test your environment by running a simple script
2. Configure any additional VS Code extensions you need
3. Set up version control if needed
