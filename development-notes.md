# Initialize Selenium WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get('https://example.com')

# Scrape Data
soup = BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source, 'html.parser')
data = soup.title.text

# Initialize CrewAI Agents with AnythingLLM
researcher = Agent(role='Researcher', goal='Discover new insights', llm=llm)
writer = Agent(role='Writer', goal='Create engaging content', llm=llm)

# Create Tasks
task1 = Task(description='Investigate the latest AI trends', agent=researcher)
task2 = Task(description='Write a blog post on AI advancements', agent=writer)

# Create Crew
crew = Crew(agents=[researcher, writer], tasks=[task1, task2], llm=llm)

# Process Tasks
crew.run()

# Close WebDriver
driver.quit()
This should help you leverage the full potential of AnythingLLM in your project, enhancing your local LLM for chat, web scraping, memory management, and database interactions.
